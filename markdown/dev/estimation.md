I should probably start by saying I *really* dislike estimating.  Most of the time it's a bit like licking your finger and sticking it into the air and the rest of the time it's even worse! Between having to (usually) quantify a large number of unknowns that can slow you down, you have to try and plan in whether the coworker helping you out isn't going to (rightly) go on sick leave just before that major dependency comes in. When you finally do give an estimate, to the people you are giving the estimate to, it's not an *estimate*, it's a guarantee and when it doesn't happen for a multitude of reasons, you get a pretty uncomfortable meeting where you have to try and explain why you didn't do what you said you would.  This feeling is so entrenched into software development that there's a pretty common 'joke' about it:

```text
person: Hey we've got this really cool feature we need adding! All you need to do is add a button to the form
developer: 3 weeks.
person: but it's just adding a button?
developer: it'll take 4 weeks.
```

However, none of this really matters, because the business needs this information to try and forecast future work, and if this doesn't happen, the company can go out of business.  So as much as I dislike doing estimates, it's still a key skill for any developer to have.
